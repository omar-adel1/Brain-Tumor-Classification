# Brain Tumor MRI Classification

This project implements a deep learning model for classifying brain tumors using MRI images. The model differentiates between four classes: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumor.

## About the Dataset

This dataset is a combination of the following three datasets:
- **figshare**
- **SARTAJ dataset**
- **Br35H**

It contains **7,023 images** of human brain MRIs classified into the following classes:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**

The **no tumor** class images were sourced from the **Br35H** dataset. It was noted that the **SARTAJ dataset** has issues with the categorization of glioma images, leading to the removal of those images in favor of more accurate images from the **figshare** site.
